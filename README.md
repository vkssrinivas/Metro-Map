# Metro-Map

# Introduction
The application is a sample metro map(i.e; we have considered Hyderabad city's metro map and some stations in it).We can use this application to understand what stations are there in between the given source city and destination city, and many more...

# Abstract
The main objective of this project is to create a replica of the Hyderabad metro map and understand how the shortest path between two metro stations can be found out using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithms since this map contains many routes(metro lanes) and junction metros (i.e; A metro station which is common to two or more lanes of the metro map) .

# Compilation:
  1. Copy the Source code to your machine.
  2. Use any source-code-editor that compiles java code(I have used Notepad++).
  3. Open both the code files in Notepad++(i.e;your source code editor) and compile the files.
     3.1 Compilation steps for Nodepad++
         3.1.1 Choose 
            File -> Choose Containing Folder -> cmd
         3.1.2 In cmd, type the following to execute the code
            javac Graph_H.java
            javac Heap.java
            java Graph_H
  4. Now you can run the code in your cmd.
